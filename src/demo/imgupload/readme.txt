This is a simple floating button creation in order to insert image to
the editing document. Use the floating menu 'insert' and click on the
blue icon to place an empty image as a place holder. Once clicking on
the holder it will pop a window up to upload an image. It will be stored
in 'uploads' folder. 

In order to make it works you will need to:

- move or link plugins/imgholder folder to the Aloha plugins/common folder.
- change permission of the 'upload' folder to world writable, ie 777.

Currently the image still not appear in the text automatically. That's
the thing needed to be done next.
